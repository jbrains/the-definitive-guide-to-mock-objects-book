## The Five-Step Wizard

Some objects act as mediators. They have the role of ensuring that we perform a bunch of steps in the correct sequence, while handling errors gracefully. I usually envision a mediator as a [Template Method](#ref-design-patterns-book). Test-driving a straightforward wizard sometimes gives me the feeling of doing "tautological TDD", but once I get off the happy path, reality sets in and it starts to look a lot less tautological.
