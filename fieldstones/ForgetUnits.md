# Forget Units

I don't care what a "unit" is. Instead, what do I want from tests?

* Accuracy (fail when they should; pass when they should)
* Unobtrusiveness (fast, repeatable, quiet unless they detect a problem)
* Detective Power (able to point to the source of the problem)

How do I get these things?
