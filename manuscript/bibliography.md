[Pereira, Fabio. *"Mockists Are Dead. Long Live Classicists."*](http://link.jbrains.ca/1iSBdZ4)

: {: #ref-mockists-are-dead} An article that introduces the idea of "tautological TDD", presumably where one writes tests that don't really check anything important, amounting to circular reasoning. Unfortunately, this article appears to blame mock objects, not the people using them, for this effect.
